	abstract = {{WebRTC} is a solid initiative for building a standardized and interoperable real-time multimedia communication technology fully integrated on the {WWW.} Opportunity or threat, {WebRTC} is relevant enough to catch the attention of all market stakeholders. In this paper, we analyze the current status of {WebRTC} and show how creating a number of server-side enablers could push this technology beyond just peer-to-peer communications and make it appealing for professional applications on the long tail. We have created an open source based server infrastructure providing those enablers and have shared the code with the community. Finally we describe how a simple {API} can be used for accessing the media capabilities of such infrastructure.},

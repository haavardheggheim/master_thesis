	abstract = {How prepared are you to build fast and efficient web applications? This eloquent book provides what every web developer should know about the network, from fundamental limitations that affect performance to major innovations for building even more powerful browser applications—including {HTTP} 2.0 and {XHR} improvements, Server-Sent Events ({SSE)}, {WebSocket}, and {WebRTC.}  Author Ilya Grigorik, a web performance engineer at Google, demonstrates performance optimization best practices for {TCP}, {UDP}, and {TLS} protocols, and explains unique wireless and mobile network optimization requirements. You’ll then dive into performance characteristics of technologies such as {HTTP} 2.0, client-side network scripting with {XHR}, real-time streaming with {SSE} and {WebSocket}, and {P2P} communication with {WebRTC.} Deliver superlative {TCP}, {UDP}, and {TLS} performance Speed up network performance over {3G/4G} mobile networks Develop fast and energy-efficient mobile applications Address bottlenecks in {HTTP} 1.x and other browser protocols Plan for and deliver the best {HTTP} 2.0 performance Enable efficient real-time streaming in the browser Create efficient peer-to-peer videoconferencing and low-latency applications with real-time {WebRTC} transports},

	abstract = {{WebRTC}, Web Real-Time Communications, will have a major impact on enterprise communications, as well as consumer communications and their interactions with enterprises. This article illustrates and discusses a number of issues that are specific to {WebRTC} enterprise usage. Some of these relate to security: firewall traversal, access control, and peer-to-peer data flows. Others relate to compliance: recording, logging, and enforcing enterprise policies. Additional enterprise considerations relate to integration and interoperation with existing communication infrastructure and session-centric telephony systems.},

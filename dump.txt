esting serves to validate that the suggested interworking components mentioned in the previous chapter accomplish their intended aim.

Since SIP is pretty much the industry standard for doing signaling in the telecommunications industry, I see this as a good approach for testing purposes.





%GENERAL NOTES%

INTRO?
There are a number of proprietary implementations that provide direct 
interactive rich communication using audio, video, collaboration, 
games, etc. between two peers' web-browsers. These are not 
interoperable, as they require non-standard extensions or plugins to 
work. \citehttp://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/charter/

ORTC Working <Group>

All IP-based 
services are progressively migrating at the edge from dedicated 
client/server protocols to Javascript APIs relying on the 
universal and service agnostic HTTP protocol. 

How can the emerging WebRTC applications integrate and interoperate with existing enterprise communication software?

% \subsection{Related Work}
% There is a great interest in interworking webRTC with existing telco services. An example is the integration with IMS. This work closely resembles the work that is done in this thesis. Currently there are gateway implemenations between webrtc and ims created by ericsson and mavenir. the 3gpp is doing work on drafting a standardized gateway implementation between webrtc and ims. Both ericsson and mavenir systems are closed to th epublic, but the 3gpp papers are open for reviewing.

Du får analysere så godt du kan og begrunne de påstander du har om arkitekturen på en god måte. Du har vel også gjort noen konkrete forsøk for å se hva som virker og hvilke problemer som er der. Du må gjerne peke på veien videre for å få verifisert dine anbefalinger.
 
Vet ikke om det var til hjelp.

I want to thank the many who has helped me with this thesis. Especially, my supervisor Lars-Petter Helland from HiB for his support and guidance. I would also like to thank Anders Øvreseth, Jeremy Cook, and Csaba Anderlik at Visual Solutions for helping me understanding how audio and video communications work in a closed enterprise environment. Finally, I want to thank Visual Solutions for giving me the opportunity to work with them.\\

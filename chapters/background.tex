This chapter will explain the background for this thesis, starting with the introduction of Visual Solutions and their practical problem. Secondly I will introduce the RTCWeb technologies and WebRTC browser APIs. Lastly I will look at the use of \gls{wrtc} on mobile devices.% look at similar technologies, and lastly look at current use cases and implementations of \gls{wrtc}.

\section{Background summary}
\gls{wrtc} brings a lot of new technologies to the table. It is an effective tool that can be used to quickly create real-time communication applications, with the added advantage of support for a lot of mobile devices. With the new APIs we can run a client on any tablet or mobile phone that has a web browser with support for the \gls{wrtc} standard. Related technologies developed by Cisco and Microsoft are more complete and are now dominating the communication space, but it's going to be interesting to see if they will loose some markets to smaller companies utilizing \gls{wrtc} in the near future. Probably the biggest problem with \gls{wrtc} right now is that the IETF working group has not agreed on a video codec yet, which is somewhat halting the development. Visual Solutions VA application is using transport technologies that needs to have added security layers to work with \gls{wrtc} and the media formats needs to be transcoded with the appropriate codecs. Also the signaling and routing needs to be enhanced to make VA work with \gls{wrtc}. In the next chapter I will describe the problems of integrating \gls{wrtc} with VA.

%Google has successfully used \gls{wrtc} in their Hangout application and on their Chromecast devices.

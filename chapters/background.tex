This chapter will explain the background for the thesis, starting with the introduction of \gls{wrtc}. Then we will look at the use of \gls{wrtc} on mobile devices, look at similar technologies, and current use cases and implementations of \gls{wrtc}. We will last look at Visual Solution's application Virtual Arena for doing collaboration such as audio, video, and application sharing.

\section{Summary}
\gls{wrtc} brings a lot of new technologies to the table. It is an effective tool that can be used to quickly create real-time communication applications, with the added advantages of being platform independant. With the new APIs we can run a client on any tablet or mobile device that has a web browser with support for the \gls{wrtc} standard. Related technologies developed by Cisco and Microsoft are more complete and are now dominating the communication space, but it's going to be interesting to see if they will loose some markets to smaller companies utilizing \gls{wrtc} in the future. Google has successfully used \gls{wrtc} in their Hangout application and on their Chromecast devices. Probably the biggest problem with \gls{wrtc} right now is that the IETF working group have not agreed on a video codec yet, which is somewhat halting the development. Visual Solutions Virtual Arena is using transport technologies that needs to have added security layers to work with \gls{wrtc} and the media formats needs to be transcoded with the appropriate codecs. Also the signaling and routing needs to be enhanced to make Virtual Arena work with \gls{wrtc}. In the next chapter we will go further into the problems of integrating \gls{wrtc} with Virtual Arena.

We have looked at some basic theory about streaming media in the web browser, and explained our experiments and their capabilities. In chapter x we looked at the testing data collected and did an analysis of the results. The results were discussed and conclusions were made. This chapter will summarize the key elements of the results, look at what contributions have been made, and suggest some future work.


To simulate a low latency environment all early experiments were done on a local network. After collecting data using different mechanisms of protocols and streaming media, they were compared with the results from the same experiments using a simulated external network. Data about traffic, latency, and cpu-load were gathered and analyzed. Then we discussed the results with regard to inconsistencies, trends, synergies between different factors, and potential conclusions that could be made.

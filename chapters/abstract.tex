Media streaming services generate a large portion of the Internet traffic every day with the biggest one being video on demand services. This thesis will focus on the use of streaming media in a collaborative environment within an enterprise setting. There are currently many such services existing today. A lot of these services are costly and use old legacy systems and are therefore not easy to upgrade to adopt the benefits of the latest technologies.

The aim of this thesis is to find the most suitable way for enterprises to implement live media sharing in the web browser. The goal is to detect different problems. In particular this thesis will look into the difficulties of streaming live audio with high quality over the different protocols.

The HTML5 standard introduces many new APIs that give web browsers the ability to communicate directly with each other in real-time. But there are many solutions and the different providers doesn't seem to agree on a single solution. This thesis will examine using these new APIs to see how we can integrate the browser in current media collaboration systems. The goal being to determine the feasability of using these new APIs and evaluate their usage. This thesis hope to aid in developing solutions for media sharing in the browser that can be used in an enterprise setting.

This chapter will try to map the current state of needed APIs in the different web browsers.

Current state of Web Real Time Communication drafts by the W3C is like this:

27-01-2014 WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers Nightly Draft

18-02-2014 Media Capture and Streams Nightly draft

04-03-2014 Mediastream Image Capture Nightly draft

As the current state of these implementations vary greatly and changes every day. I choose to only look at the implementations that I need in both Firefox and chrome, since these two browsers has by far implemented the most and is somewhat cooperating in gettings things to work interoperable. Another thing is the use of prefixes.

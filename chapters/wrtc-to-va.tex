In this section I will point out the differences between the gateway used for testing and the gateway that would have to be implemented for VA. Starting with the traffic proxy and media server. Then I will describe the differences in the signaling. Lastly I will introduce the enterprise firewall.

Traffic Proxy and Media Server

VA media server would receive the streams and 

Signaling
is done proprietiely in VA, but WRTC allows for anything as long as u include SDP. This

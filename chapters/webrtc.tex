This chapter will take a look at the new \ac{html5} \ac{webrtc} API that utilizes UDP for doing live streaming in the browser. The goal is to allow real-time communication in the browser. The specifications are still in draft, but there is a lot of experiments using this new API publicly available. This thesis will aid in doing such experiments. How we can use WebRTC interworking in an enterprise setting. What other APIs can we use alongside WebRTC within the web browser.
